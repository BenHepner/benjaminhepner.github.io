# Ben Hepner – Computer Science ePortfolio

Welcome to my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio for CS 499.

## Capstone Project
**Health Tracker Application**

This project demonstrates my skills in:
- Software Engineering and Design
- Algorithms and Data Structures
- Databases

Original Health Tracker Application:
This project is an Android-based health tracking app developed earlier in my Computer Science program. The application allows users to create accounts, log weight entries with dates, set goals, and view their weight history. The original version focused on core functionality, basic data storage using SQLite, and user interaction through a simple mobile interface. This code serves as the baseline artifact used for later enhancements in software engineering, algorithms, and database design as part of my CS 499 capstone.

Milestone One - Health Tracker Code Review:
This video provides a walkthrough and analysis of the original Health Tracker application code completed as part of my CS 499 capstone. In this review, I identify limitations, design issues, and areas for improvement related to software engineering, algorithms, and database structure. The review explains my plan for enhancements, including improvements to data validation, database relationships, and application functionality. This code review serves as the foundation for the enhancements implemented throughout the capstone project.

Milestone Two – Software Design and Engineering Enhancement:
This enhancement builds on the original Health Tracker application to improve overall software structure, reliability, and usability. Updates included fixing the date input process, improving input validation, standardizing weight entries to pounds, and refining how data is passed and stored within the app. These changes demonstrate applied software engineering practices such as debugging, modular design, and user-focused functionality improvements as part of my CS 499 capstone.

Milestone Three – Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement:
This enhancement expands the Health Tracker application by improving how weight data is processed and displayed using structured data handling and algorithmic logic. Updates included organizing entries into structured objects, sorting data chronologically, and implementing a rolling average calculation to show weight trends over time. These changes demonstrate the use of data structures, algorithm design, and efficiency considerations as part of my CS 499 capstone.

Milestone Four – Databases Enhancement:
This enhancement improves the Health Tracker application’s database design to better reflect real-world software practices. Updates included restructuring the SQLite schema, linking weight entries to individual users using a user ID, improving data validation, and strengthening how data is stored and retrieved. These changes demonstrate applied database design, data integrity, and multi-user support as part of my CS 499 capstone.
